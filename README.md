#SpotFinder#
##An app to help you shred!##
This is a web app using JS, JSON, and MongoDB to bring you local spots nearby! The site is
hosted on AWS and offers users the opportunity to find skate spots near them. Whether you're
looking for a skatepark, a ledge, stairset, handrail, or even just a good hill to bomb,
spotfinder takes input from the local skater community and displays all the good spots in town so
you know where to go.
